        After the newborn stage sitter sessions are the next cutest stage, these
        take place usually between 7-9 months once your baby is sitting. At this
        age you can really see their little personalities shining through!

        “We had our newborn photoshoot with Jo and genuinely, it was one of the
        best decisions we’ve made since having our baby”
      </h6>
      <p>
        Jo radiates kindness and warmth, and really was just such a joy to be
        around during our photoshoot. She was so unbelievably patient and gentle
        with our newborn. The end result? The most STUNNING selection of
        photographs of our baby girl and family that genuinely made me cry my
        eyes out! Every single shot is just so beautiful, we loved them. Jo –
        thank you SOOOOOOOO much for being so kind and patient with us. You
        really are so incredibly talented, and we cannot wait to come back for
        more photos! Wishing you every bit of success – you really deserve it so
        much.
