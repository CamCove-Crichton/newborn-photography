      <h4>NEWBORN BABY PHOTOS SWANLEY- CREATING BEAUTIFUL MEMORIES</h4>
      <br />
      <h5>Elianaâ€™s newborn session</h5>
      <p>
        Photographing all of these little tiny newborn is always such a
        privilege! If you are looking to book in a newborn photoshoot these
        sessions are best when your little one is under 2 weeks of age. I do
        photograph newborn up to 8 weeks old, the older they get the the more
        awake the photos may be rather than sleepy poses, thats not to say you
        still canâ€™t get the cutest photos.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h5>Here is some information about the sessions</h5>
      <ul>
